Project 3 Lighting and Shadows


compile: > make
run: > ./shadow


everything works. Nothing to complain about, the animations are smooth, the colors and shadows
correspond to the light movement

text shoortcuts for animations are 

b - start ball movement
n - stop ball movement

z - zoom in
o - zoom out

j - pan left
l - pan right

a - move light negative x axis
d - move light positive x axis

w - move light postive y axis
s - move light negative y axis

q - move light negative z axis
e - move light positive z axis

r - kill program


thats about it.
