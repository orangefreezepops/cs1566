compile: > make
run: > ./maze


the maze doesnt do anything but display and spin
I couldnt get an alogrithm to work to dynamically create a maze
you can see I have about 4 separate maze files included in this folder, all of
which are small variations of eachother and failed

couldn't build the zoom in functionality

there are no other bugs, everyting that I've tried to add works
